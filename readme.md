# Eat&Home

Eat & Home is a Food Delivery application. The system was created by developing two different applications, intended respectively for customers and restaurateurs. The customer application provides the ability to search for a restaurant based on the user's location, to select a restaurant category to choose from, to view information, menus and reviews of this restaurant. Furthermore, you can add dishes to the cart, modify the cart, enter the data necessary to complete the order (address, time and date of delivery, type of payment). Finally, you can view the history of the orders placed or follow the progress of the order just made. The restaurateur's application allows you to create and modify your menu, enter and update restaurant information, view reviews and orders received, update the progress of an order.
Project developed during the User Interaction Design course @ [Department of Computer Science](https://www.uniba.it/ricerca/dipartimenti/informatica) @ [University of Bari "Aldo Moro"](http://www.uniba.it/) under the supervision of dr. [Berardina Nadja De Carolis](http://www.di.uniba.it/~nadja/).

## Analysis
In the design phase of the interaction with the user, the following prototypes were created:
* Low fidelity prototypes
* High fidelity prototypes

## Usability Assessment
The following tests were carried out in the usability evaluation phase:
* For low fidelity prototypes
   * Cognitive Walkthrough
   * Scenario test
* For high fidelity prototypes
   * Task test
   * SUS
   * QUIS
